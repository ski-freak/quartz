# Hello!
I'm SkiFreak, I'm now using this as my website, blog, and place for work in progress projects/video scripts. I like making things on the internet, and you can find it all here (or at least links).
## Get Started
Here are some places you may want to visit:

> 📚 I host a few different things on this site, and they are sorted by tags:
- [#Navigation](https://ski-freak.github.io/quartz/tags/navigation/) - Pages designed to organize other pages.
- [#Post](https://ski-freak.github.io/quartz/tags/post/) - Complete posts, at least mostly thought out ideas that are ready to be read, although their subjects may not be completed. If you just want a feed of everything here, check it out.
- [#idea](https://ski-freak.github.io/quartz/tags/idea/) - Small notes or thoughts that may be referred to in other posts or expanded on later.
- [#Video](https://ski-freak.github.io/quartz/tags/video/) - Posts about or containing videos I have published. You can find reflections on videos after I release them, and maybe other things.
- [#WipVideo](https://ski-freak.github.io/quartz/tags/wipvideo/) - Work in progress video scripts. I put these here to share with others to get feedback, usually via links. If you have insight on or are otherwise rather knowledgeable on the topic of any of these, feel free to send me a message on discord (@skifreak). I can always use more information, fact checking, or ideas for interesting things to include.
