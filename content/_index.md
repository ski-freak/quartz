# Hello!
I'm SkiFreak, I'm now using this as my website, blog, and place for work in progress projects/video scripts. I like making things on the internet, and you can find it all here (or at least links).

You may know me from one of my self titled youtube channels or Trackmania mapping. My interests include technology related stuff, video games, card games, making videos, mapping in Trackmania, skiing, & mountain biking.

- [[My Projects]] - Projects and things I'm trying to make happen.
- [All Posts](./tags/posts) - All posts/articles on this website in one chronological feed, under the posts tag. If you want to see what's going on here, look no further.

> [!note] Articles & series on this site

- [Reflections](./tags/reflections) - Reflections is a series about looking back on videos and other projects of mine that have been completed.
- [TM Theory](./tags/tmtheory) - TM Theory is a series about my ideas, opinions, and theories pertaining to Trackmania.
- [The Lens](./tags/thelens) - The Lens is a series where I look at, and possibly over or under analyze whatever is on my mind. Topics are likely to be related to technology, the social landscape of the internet, and youtube.
- [WIP Video](./tags/wipvideo) - Work in progress video scripts. I put these here to share with others to get feedback, usually via links. If you have insight on or are otherwise rather knowledgeable on the topic of any of these, feel free to send me a message on discord (@skifreak). I can always use more information, fact checking, or ideas for interesting things to include.

Posts that don't fit into any of these can still be found under the [#Posts](./tags/posts) tag, including some small ones also going by the ideas tag. 

It's possible I will make some of these text posts into videos at some point, but editing little videos is kind of annoying to me. I like editing videos where I am trying to make the best thing I can, not just trying to get through the tedious process since all of the important decisions have already been made when writing. I guess if I find someone who would want to edit for a percentage of the single digit revenues the videos generate that could work out.

> [!example] Tags

I host a few different things on this site, and they are sorted by tags:
- 📁 [#Navigation](./tags/navigation) - Navigation pages are designed to organize other pages.
- 🌲 [#Evergreen](./tags/evergreen) - Evergreen pages are always kept up to date. 
- 📫 [#Posts](./tags/posts) - Complete posts, at least mostly thought out ideas that are ready to be read, although their subjects may not be completed. If you just want a feed of everything here, check it out.
- 💡 [#Ideas](ideas.md) - Small notes or thoughts that may be referred to in other posts or expanded on later.
- 📺 [#Video](./tags/video) - Posts about or containing videos I have published. You can find reflections on videos after I release them, and maybe other things.

> [!info] Tips

- You can find a [full list of tags here](/tags/), if you would like to find posts on certain topics.
- You can use *ctrl + k* to easily open up the search function, which can search both the names and contents of pages on this site, and will also display related pages to help if you forgot the name.
- Each page also has *backlinks* and a *graph view*. Backlinks show you all other pages on the site that mention the one you are currently on. The graph view shows all related pages in a cool little graph. It's also a nice fidget toy.
- In the corner of the graph view there is a button that opens the global graph, which graphs all pages on this site!
