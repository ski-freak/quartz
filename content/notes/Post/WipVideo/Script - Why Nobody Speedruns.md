This is the history of the ultra shortcut, by summoning salt, one of the most famous and recognizable speedrunning youtubers. It's a fascinating documentary about how Mario Kart Wii players were able to completely break certain tracks, creating some incredible shortcuts. This video alone has over 12 million views. Mario kart Wii sold 37 million copies. About a thousand people have speedran mario kart wii.

{nobody cares about speedrunning title}

Speedrunning is a relatively simple concept, finish a game or complete a goal as fast as possible. Players have been competing to be the fastest to beat various games for decades, even before the internet, but it really took off in the 2010s* when speedruns and related videos gained immense popularity on youtube. Despite this, the player base for actually speedrunning remains microscopic to this day compared to the tens of millions of people worldwide who enjoy watching speedrun videos and livestreams.

It is undeniable that there is at least a perceived barrier to entry to speedrun most games. Being expected to read community made rules, record yourself, and submit your attempt to a 3rd party website is a bit more involved than downloading a new game and playing it. Many may also get the impression that they need a fancy timer or certain mods or to learn a complex route simply to get started. Some games are only available on console or emulator, the former of which may be harder to record from and the latter can be a bit of a process to set up, but even pc games never seem to have a big speedrunning scene either.

Most games would kill to have the amount of attention that has been directed at even relatively unpopular speedruns, and yet speedrunning largely remains contained to youtube and twitch streams. 
Still, to me this doesn't fully explain the absurdly small amount of players relative to viewers, surely 20 million people aren't so lazy that only a few hundredths of a percent of them have actually given it a try? Perhaps it is worth examining whether the very videos that have made speedrunning a global phenomenon are the reason it remains such a niche community.

When you see how mario kart players do near perfect inputs and grab invisible checkpoints to achieve ultra shortcuts, does that make you want to pick up mario kart wii and speedrun it? Probably not, slamming yourself into a wall over and over until you get a trick isn't a very appealing prospect, but does make for a really interesting video. 

Beyond general documentaries about interesting events and people, speedrunning videos have found a number popular formats. There's the world record uploads, tool assisted speedruns, videos explaining runs, world record progression videos, videos about cheaters, as well as challenge runs & other videos that revolve around a creator doing some kind of run for content.

The thing about most of these video genres is that they directly benefit from sensationalizing or otherwise focusing on the extremes of speedrunning to create an entertaining video. Accomplishments and skilled runners are hyped into the stratosphere, and difficult parts of runs such as skips are focused on. This all makes sense, and there isn't really anything inherently wrong with it. If you're going to make a video, you're probably going to gravitate to the coolest and most interesting events. You're probably going to focus on the most difficult challenges faced, it's how narratives tend to work. However, what creates a good video and engaging narrative often doesn't align with what most people would be interested in playing themselves. 

{wr progression edit}
The world record progression format practically necessitates consistently increasing the stakes and gravity of accomplishments as the video goes on, or at least keeping it at a constant. It of course also tends to focus on the strangest stories and most difficult achievements and obstacles players faced. Each new discovery, new route, new skip must be presented in an exciting or entertaining way, each new record better than the last. World record progressions aren't bad, they're essentially a vehicle to explore how a speedrun evolved over time, but they often don't present something that would be fun for the average person. 

Challenge runs and other weird speedruns are interesting, and in some ways they can be more accessible than an actual speedrun, seeing as you may be willing to participate without submitting to a leaderboard. Players have been putting restrictions on their playthroughs and going for weird goals for as long as games have been around. The thing is, as time goes on it seems like more and more often these challenges and alternate speedruns that creators do are focused on being novel and clickable, as more concepts become old and stale. There's tons of videos on youtube of people "speedrunning" random objectives as a spectacle. {insert clickable challenge that is barely even a speedrun and is basically just a random thing for views}.

People are fascinated with cheaters. Speedrun cheating videos have long been extremely popular, and for a long time a majority of the most viewed speedrun related videos on youtube were about cheaters and cheated runs. {possibly cut this {It goes without saying that while they make for interesting stories, cheaters aren't exactly appealing.}} While I doubt that they scare many away, I'm sure they're not convincing anyone to speedrun, at least anyone legitimate.
{that's right, we're gonna cheat clip}

Now what if an entire game fell into this same problem, a game with near zero advertisement and popular content that doesn't reflect what a normal player would do.

Trackmania is a racing game that, in essence, condenses the gameplay loop of speedrunning down to individual short, fast paced tracks. There's a lot more to the game, for example live races against other players such as the cup of the day, and powerful editor tools that allow for the creation of some truly insane race tracks, but the main way most people interact with the game is trying to set fast times on individual levels.

If you've heard of trackmania, it was probably in one of a few ways. You may have seen press forward maps, auto levels with crazy flips where you simply hold a single input and the map drives itself. These have always been popular on youtube and have in recent years gained a new {following} as common background visual stimulation footage for tiktoks. These are visually cool, and there is a certain craft to building this kind of track, but they obviously don't reflect actual gameplay at all and most viewers will never think twice about the game that made them possible.

The most popular content creator for trackmania by far is wirtual, who makes videos similar to that of some speedrunning channels. Many of these videos feature records, tricks, and shortcuts, unique challenges, and more, often in an older entry in the series, trackmania nations forever. Just like speedrunning videos, you don't have to look far into the comments to see people talking about how they've never played the game and love the video.

You wouldn't think it's weird if I said that 15 million view Press Forward map videos & tiktok backgrounds don't attract many people to the game, and really press forward maps are about as different as uberbug world record grinders are to the gameplay loop of typical players. Most trackmania players are not grinding incredibly inconsistent shortcuts and trying to get perfect runs,

the appeal to trackmania is in a way the same as speedrunning: it's fun to try to improve your personal best, reaching for your own goal.

Trackmania isn't a big game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not dead either. The barrier to entry to trackmania is much lower than speedrunning a game, even though the gameplay loop has an obvious resemblance.

The technical factors and accessibility are just as important as the content in my opinion for attracting players to any game or sub game, but it seems easy to overlook how the presentation of speedruns to the wider internet may be a major factor in why nobody speedruns.

As I said at the beginning, being expected to read community made rules, record yourself, and submit your attempt to a 3rd party website is a bit more involved than downloading a new game and playing it. Unless the process of onboarding players is streamlined significantly, it seems likely that speedrunning will continue to be a niche activity for the foreseeable future. For console exclusive games this is effectively impossible, as it will always require extra effort to record, or emulate a console game. PC games possibly have a bit more hope though. Perhaps some games could have mods that create a sort of speedrun mode that records a replay of the gameplay and serves as an automatic submission to a leaderboard. How much effort it takes as a player to mod a game varies depending on the title, what would be ideal is developer support.

Celeste includes a speedrun mode with a timer, and this is great, it removes a step that you would normally have to set up to run the game, but I think the concept could be taken further. With a replay system built into a game, it would be a lot easier and more convenient for new players to get video proof of their runs. Maybe within the speedrun mode menu you could have an easy way to submit your best replay to the speedrun.com page and it's community moderators. Having an in game leaderboard would be sick, and some games actually do this when it's part of the core gameplay, such as Neon White, but the sad reality of these is that they often get filled with cheaters, and it's not very realistic to ask developers to implement anti cheat in their mostly single player games or verify the runs themselves.

It seems unlikely that any triple a game would bother with this, but seeing as we've seen indy games take small steps already like the celeste speedrun mode, maybe other indy games will push the concept further in the future. There's a huge amount of viewership for speedrun content, and if you could attract more players from it by making it easy to participate that would theoretically make more money.

In fact, recently we saw the perfect example of a game that could have benefited from a speedrun replay mode or leaderboard: Only Up. If you somehow managed to miss it, Only Up is a Platformer slash rage game that took the streaming and speedrun space by storm this May. There's one level filled with a bunch of random 3d assets, and you need to jump all the way up to the top, and if you fall, it's a long way down with no checkpoints. On release Only Up quickly rose to be the most popular speedgame, if any game could have benefited from attracting more players from speedrun content it would have been this one.

Another thing I saw recently is the developer of an indie automation game

This video isn't meant to say that any of the content I mentioned is bad, I quite like a lot of it. In the end all publicity may be good publicity, but in the absence of developer support you'll need a lot more than good to convince people to speedrun.

Thanks for watching.


Note: make and record both trackmania explaining bits

Note: add these
- But what you need to understand is that a perceived barrier to entry is essentially the same as an actual one when it comes to attracting participants to something. They will not know that it is not actually that bad until after they have surpassed the barrier or lack of it.
- im sure anyone making a video on a game with such a feature it would mention how easy it is to go speedrun for yourself
- even if a replay system is not as fool proof as video recording, the leaderboard could simply require video verification for top runs.
