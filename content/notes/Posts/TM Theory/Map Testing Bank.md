In this post I will compile some map tests I have done (and a few from others).

Most of these were done for the purpose of the mapper improving their future maps or making small edits to their current map. Existing maps cannot be easily rebuilt. This also differs greatly from making a case study or general critique of a map or styles of building, which is very interesting and arguably better, but much more involved for the creator of the review & less useful for a mapper just looking for quick feedback. That could be more useful for examining a map you personally find to be notably cool. General discussions of mapping theory are also very nice, but I've mostly only seen that with just me and nix yapping on stream. For more involved things, scripted is always better obviously, but it is far more work and in my experience map feedback is mostly done out of pure altruism, if I want to spend hours making a cool video, I'd rather make something else unfortunately. The short reviews will generally focus more on the negative aspects & things that I personally found to be notably cool, & describe everything else as 'fine'. This is arguably somewhat negative in tone, but it's just how I roll with these I guess as I think it's the most efficient and honest way of going about it, as these reviews are meant to be communications of why I like/dislike a map. Longer reviews/critiques could go beyond that.

A few examples of longer reviews/critiques
- Vneck's Quantum Supernova review (essay, very good) [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rysCD70wu8)
	- Here is a small bonus yapping [[Map Testing Bank Bonus Yap]]
- Void review from Ski & Agra (20 minute discussion) [link](https://youtu.be/blWyuKXZh0o)

General mapping theory discussions
- Speedfun & a Rex map [link](https://youtu.be/5P8W9l9A5vk)
- Risky fin discussion with Agrabou (long podcast) [link](https://youtu.be/A-n9j3SmWto)

My short map feedbacks (video form)
- [Elliot double map review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3djTgeQjwtc)
- [Ekstrem Kulde Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvSps2cQ62U)
- [Vinyl Review](https://youtu.be/blWyuKXZh0o)
- [Velv mixed map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e2Hl9bA9VU) (he specifically asked about overspeed on one part)

I also have done a lot of talking about maps on stream (and Nix's stream), but they are not saved anywhere unfortunately, that's generally where I tend to go into more detail on theorizing about maps.

Below are some of my short text + image reviews:
