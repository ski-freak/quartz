So last weekend I had a very specific and very silly idea: make a video complaining about trackmania bugs in the style of a news report, and call it the Bug Report. This idea was derivative of an earlier one, where someone asked me my least favorite editor bugs and I proceeded to list 20 of them in twitch chat, and say I should make it into a youtube video of me yelling about all of them. The difference with this new concept was that it would be focused far more on actual jokes than just the inherent comedy of someone being very animated and upset about obscure things.

Anyway I proceeded to write a bunch of random silly shit, and read it out in a vaguely authoritative voice. This went by rather quickly, I wrote the script very quickly and it was rather short, and I've gotten much much better at recording voiceover over the last year. Editing took many hours however, as is probably expected.

I got whiskey and mime to pretend to be interviewed, which was pretty funny. Whiskey wrote his own part and mime just read an old tweet of mine. I also had the idea to write some stuff for a pretend reporter to read out, but I ended up not doing that as I just wanted to make the damn video rather than waiting to find someone else to record for me. If I make another bug report, this will definitely be the main addition.

That said, I don't know when or if I will make another. I feel like I used a lot of really obvious jokes I already had thought of or been aware of before making the video, so I would worry about the comedy being worse. The main reason though, is just that it takes a long time to edit for a 3 minute video and I feel like I've already been there done that when it comes to the concept. If I feel like it randomly or have the opportunity to make a bug report on a different game, I might do that.

I said I would only make a sequel anyway and continue the series if I knew it was going to be successful, meaning if the first one got a lot of views. Keissla and others mentioned that if I don't try a few times I won't really know, and trying once and giving up is kinda lame. While this is somewhat true, I already have another time sink available to try to make successful, the [[Main YouTube Channel]]. That channel has much more potential for me to make a variety of videos and do something new each time, than continuing a series and just doing the same thing again, and I believe it has a much greater potential to reach a larger audience as the Trackmania bug report requires you to be familiar with the culture surrounding Trackmania for it to be enjoyable and funny.
