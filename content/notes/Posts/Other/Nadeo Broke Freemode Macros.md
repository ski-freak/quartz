im 99% sure that nadeo ruined a good portion of freemode mapping. Most blocks rotate from a corner, and this becomes an issue if you want to make for example a 45 degree wall, as the axis of rotation will be off and it won't line up. The top half quarterpipe however rotates from the center, so you can use it to rotate things in a perfect circle. Entry made a wacky wheel macroblock with some wallrides surrounding one so that you can make 45 degree walls for example.

This is the Entrylag macroblock:

HOWEVER! At some point it seems nadeo broke macroblocks and rotation points, so now if you make a macroblock of the top half quaterpipe with whatever blocks you want to rotate properly, it will just rotate from the shitty corner position anyway, WHY!??! So now every time I want to make a new thing that rotates from that block, I need to use the entry wheel macroblock, then create a new macroblock that attatches onto the entry one (heaven forbid I ever at some point want to do something where this doesn't work, luckily I havent noticed that yet), then move the new thing into place with copy paste tool.

Â I get out my macro gadget gizmo by Entrylaggus and I take it to mappus reviewus and I become mapper awareus when my map gets one star votesus.
