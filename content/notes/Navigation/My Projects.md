I'm using the word project rather loosly here, basically any ongoing interest that involves me making something, along with actual projects.

# [[Articles & Posts]]
Moving forward I will be making some text posts / articles on this website. Here are some series I am making:
- [#Reflection](./tags/reflection) - Reflections is a series about looking back on videos and other projects of mine that have been completed.
- [#TM Theory](./tags/tmtheory) - TM Theory is a series about my ideas and theories pertaining to Trackmania.
- [#TheLens](./tags/thelens) - The Lens is a series where I look at, and possibly over or under analyze whatever is on my mind. Topics are likely to be related to technology, the social landscape of the internet, and youtube.
- [#Post](./tags/post) - All the posts in one chronological feed.

# [[Main YouTube Channel]]
My 'main' YouTube channel is currently the project I take the most seriously, or rather care about the most. I'm making videos that I think are interesting, not tied to any format or topic, and trying to get better at it. The videos ideally should all be understandable by a general audience, and not require any previous knowledge on the subjects.

# [[SkiFreakTM Channel]] 
Currently functioning as my second channel. Originally made for scripted trackmania content, since my focus shifted to the newÂ [Main YouTube Channel](app://obsidian.md/Main%20YouTube%20Channel). Moving forward I am posting basically anything that I want to make that doesn't fit on the main channel here, so probably trackmania commentary and shower thought tier videos, along with anything goofy I come up with.

# [[My Trackmania Mapping]]
For the last few years Trackmania has been my main game, mostly because I enjoy the racing sandbox aspect that the map editor gives. I've built a whole bunch of maps, and you can find them all on my [tmx profile](https://trackmania.exchange/user/profile/27633) to download and [tm replay channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatSkiFreak) to view

# Project Gamma
Project Gamma is a drafting card game / custom cube I have been working on with a few others. I will make more information available when the game is ready to be played at least in a beta state. If you would like to help with the design of the game mechanics, the cards (we need 360), or visuals, feel free to reach out.

# Project Delta
Project Delta is a Trackmania event hosting group run by me, CD, and Nixotica. The goal was a return to form in Trackmania competitions, however, as the competitive tm landscape has shifted over time that seems to have become less attainable, and we have lost some amount of motivation. We still run the Delta KO however, which is a fun seasonal endurance knockout competition where half of all players are knocked out each round on 6-10 minute tracks.

Another attempt at improving competitive Trackmania may return in the future with more NCSA regional events (north and south america). You can join the discord servers for [Project Delta](https://discord.gg/Nj2rDjqQPh) and [NCSA Events](https://discord.gg/kSgbTT9eqQ).

# A list of smaller things:
- I keep a [playlist of cool youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLrcnPKLZ__j3Spdl99pKYed1x0sECaPa), if you're starved for video content, maybe check it out. If I think a video is really good, I add it!
