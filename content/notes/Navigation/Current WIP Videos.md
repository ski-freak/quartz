Work in progress video scripts. I put these here to share with others to get feedback, usually via links. If you have insight on or are otherwise rather knowledgeable on the topic of any of these, feel free to send me a message on discord (@skifreak). I can always use more information, fact checking, or ideas for interesting things to include.

Note that not all of these will ever be finished, and they are of course not complete or ready to be published, and may contain falsehoods or ideas I no longer agree with.
