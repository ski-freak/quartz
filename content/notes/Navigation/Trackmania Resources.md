This is an index of trackmania resources, especially for mapping, both on this site and external. 
- If you're new here, you can search for pages across the site with ctrl +k, and return to related pages using the interactive graph on the right (although its kind of broken on this page specifically because it has so many links). For more info visit the main page.
- You may need to use ctrl+f5 to force this page to update with newly added resources.

# Mapping Resources:


### [[TM Transition Bank]]
- Probably what you are looking for :)
### Files & Tools
- [Sorted Trackmania Item Set](https://github.com/ski-freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted) - I maintain a sorted collection of custom Trackmania blocks and items on github. This has basically all the (route) custom items people use (very few scenery items).
- Thumbnail replacement [tool](https://openplanet.dev/file/14). Lets you set any image as the in game map thumbnail, although the aspect ratio dings are a little wacky.
### Short guides to doing things
- [[TM Replay Render Settings]] - Information for rendering replays properly.
- [[Extracting custom items and blocks]] from maps.
- Whiskey's video tutorial on making [custom respawn locations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZ-IfxzDu4). Check the pinned comment for a faster workflow.
- A [[Guide to 3d Triangles]].
- [[Oso's block height guide]].

### Freemode Mapping Techniques
- [Entrylag's freemode macroblock guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Iq0FWt6ztGnQsbEaYRCSjYYb37wRAZk/view). The most important thing to understand for doing wicked shit in freemode. Allows you to align groups of items and blocks to other groups in freemode
- [[Skybaxrider's item alignment tech]]. Allows you to align blocks of different slopes to each other. Especially useful when combined with macroblocks.
### New mapper information
- Trackmania wiki page for the [map editor](https://wiki.trackmania.io/en/content-creation/map-editor). Contains hotkeys and such.

### Console mapper information

- The TMA (trackmania mapper assembly) [discord](https://discord.gg/b8MfZsYFWg) has a lot of useful stuff for mapping and is one of the better places to go to get feedback on your maps and ask questions.
