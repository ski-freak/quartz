## My Resources
- [Sorted Trackmania Item Set](https://github.com/ski-freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted) - I maintain a sorted collection of custom Trackmania blocks and items on github. This has basically all the (route) custom items people use (very few scenery items).
- [[TM Replay Render Settings]] - Information for rendering replays properly.
## Other Resources
- Openplanet https://openplanet.dev - Allows you to add plugins and modify the game. Maybe I'll make a plugin list here sometime. 
- Stadiumless [map bases](https://openplanet.dev/file/48).
- Shootmania guy [base map](https://openplanet.dev/file/47) (nadeo killed shootmania guy though :( )
- In game map thumbnail replacement [tool](https://openplanet.dev/file/14). Lets you set any image as the in game map thumbnail, although the aspect ratio dings are a little wacky.

## TM Transition Bank
Just a collection of images of interesting transitions and jumps. Should be pretty useful since it seems that a lot of transitions seem to get forgotten and almost never used while a few are very common and used all the time.

- If you have a transition I should add, just send me an image of it on discord @skifreak.
- Only on grid transitions, items allowed.
- Lmk of any errors such as duplicates or miscategorized transitions and I'll fix them.
- The page names are based on height/block type, not surface or level of banking. It should be obvious what this means when you start looking.
- I'd like to avoid adding 15 slightly different versions of the same transition.
- You may need to use ctrl+f5 to force the pages to update with newly added images rather than just using your browser's cache.

I'll make a page for fs transitions (across all road types) if people send me some to add i guess but for now I don't have one.
