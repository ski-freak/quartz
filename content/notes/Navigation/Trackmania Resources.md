- If you're new here, you can search for pages across the site with ctrl +k, and return to related pages using the interactive graph on the right (although its kind of broken on this page specifically because it has so many links). For more info visit the main page.

# Mapping Resources:
### Files & Tools
- [Sorted Trackmania Item Set](https://github.com/ski-freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted) - I maintain a sorted collection of custom Trackmania blocks and items on github. This has basically all the (route) custom items people use (very few scenery items).
- Thumbnail replacement [tool](https://openplanet.dev/file/14). Lets you set any image as the in game map thumbnail, although the aspect ratio dings are a little wacky.
### Short guides to doing things
- [[TM Replay Render Settings]] - Information for rendering replays properly.
- [[Extracting custom items and blocks]] from maps.
- Whiskey's video tutorial on making [custom respawn locations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZ-IfxzDu4). Check the pinned comment for a faster workflow.
- A [[Guide to 3d Triangles]].
- [[Oso's block height guide]].
- How to add a gps to your map [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blGq9cIHOXY&pp=ygUdc2t5bGluZXIgdHJhY2ttYW5pYSB0dXRvcmlhbHM%3D).
- How to add camera changes to your map [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXo9DMCSbOw)
### Map bases & information
- Stadiumless [map bases](https://openplanet.dev/file/48).
- Shootmania guy [base map](https://openplanet.dev/file/47) (nadeo killed shootmania guy though :( )
- [[Create your own stadiumless map file]] (with any size).
### Freemode Mapping Techniques
- [Entrylag's freemode macroblock guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Iq0FWt6ztGnQsbEaYRCSjYYb37wRAZk/view). The most important thing to understand for doing wicked shit in freemode. Allows you to align groups of items and blocks to other groups in freemode
- [[Skybaxrider's item alignment tech]]. Allows you to align blocks of different slopes to each other. Especially useful when combined with macroblocks.
### New mapper information
- Trackmania wiki page for the [map editor](https://wiki.trackmania.io/en/content-creation/map-editor). Contains hotkeys and such.
- Openplanet https://openplanet.dev - Allows you to add plugins and modify the game. Maybe I'll make a plugin list here sometime. 
- [[Openplanet mapping plugins list]]
- Flink's [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/FnT9gvrINvE) on using the map editor.
- A [video](https://youtu.be/eQDRoJAUlW4?si=U7UxJ8ZiPXEm2yea) going over most of the different track styles people build. 
### Console mapper information
- [[Uploading your map to tmx from console]] to share it with others.
### External Resources & discords
- The Trackmania Scenery Hub [discord](https://discord.gg/yMSnpjUPEG) has a lot of resources related to scenery, custom objects, and media tracker.
- The TMA (trackmania mapper assembly) [discord](https://discord.gg/b8MfZsYFWg) has a lot of useful stuff for mapping and is one of the better places to go to get feedback on your maps and ask questions.
### Fun stuff
- I host mapping competitions monthly ish in my [discord](https://discord.gg/sRB54zg).

# TM Transition Bank
Just a collection of images of interesting transitions and jumps. Should be pretty useful since it seems that a lot of transitions seem to get forgotten and almost never used while a few are very common and used all the time.

- If you have a transition I should add, just send me an image of it on discord @skifreak.
- Only on grid transitions, items allowed.
- Lmk of any errors such as duplicates or miscategorized transitions and I'll fix them.
- The page names are based on height/block type, not surface or level of banking. It should be obvious what this means when you start looking.
- I'd like to avoid adding 15 slightly different versions of the same transition.
- You may need to use ctrl+f5 to force the pages to update with newly added images rather than just using your browser's cache.

I'll make a page for fs transitions (across all road types) if people send me some to add i guess but for now I don't have one.
