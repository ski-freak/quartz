The uniqueness of trackmania and the nature of speedrunning

This is a video about how there is nothing else like trackmania, what makes it different than speedrunning & other games, and how that sucks because nadeo is bad. The differences from speedrunning may need a bit more fleshing out, any help with the script in general is appreciated.

Trackmania is a racing game. That's about the simplest and most obvious thing you can say about it, however I think it is also a terrible description that entirely misses the point of the game and what makes it stick for people {id like a better phrase here}. As far as I can tell the majority of trackmania's core playerbase doesn't even care about other racing games.

Every once in a while someone who has never seen trackmania will stumble into a live stream of it and ask the same question: why are you driving the same race over and over? The answer is that trackmania is almost entirely based on time trials. There is almost never any external or random factor that affects your runs, and every input counts for saving just a little bit more time. It is a game about setting the fastest time you can on individual short, fast paced maps, and then going just a little bit faster. Trackmania is a speedrunning game.

Now most players do not say they are speedrunning maps, we use a different word, hunting, which for all intents and purposes just means grinding or running an individual level. That said while Trackmania does utilize what is essentially the speedrunning gameplay loop, it's not exactly the same overall experience, and there really is nothing else like trackmania.

Because of the focus on individual, relatively straightforward levels using universal mechanics, the game ends up being much more about getting comfortable with and understanding the intricacies of the car's physics than learning a route and executing on it. This is in stark contrast to how most speedruns operate. When I went to go speedrun Celeste, I had to learn a route through the entire game. To speedrun most games, this process of studying and learning the currently known optimal path, or an easier version of it, is pretty much required. In trackmania when you open up a new map, you'll quickly learn the path and then use your skill and game knowledge to drive the best time you can. Speedrunning is generally speaking a much more communal activity, where all players are working to push the limits of a single run and new players will need to try to internalize all that accumulated knowledge of the route when they start. The only time where that really occurs in trackmania is when there is the occasional shortcut, and in that case it's just one thing that you are informed of and know.

This may seem a bit odd if the only thing you've heard or know of in trackmania is the tmnf campaign, however, what you need to understand is that the majority of the core playerbase has always had it's focus elsewhere than the official campaigns, on something else, user created maps.

The stadium car isn't how trackmania started. The series actually had a number of games with a slew of different cars before eventually introducing the stadium environment in nations eswc, and it became extremely popular with the release of the free trackmania nations forever in 2008. The stadium car was never meant to be driven the way players ended up driving it, apparently even drifting wasn't intended. Like Melee it turned out there was an absurd amount of optimizations and tricks that pushed the skill ceiling and mechanical depth into the stratosphere. I would start to sound like a summoning salt video if I tried to explain the why this run is 1 second faster this other run. Trackmania also features an incredibly powerful map editor, and mappers have been pushing the boundaries of the game ever since, focusing on creativity, defined map styles, flow.

Nobody builds maps the way nadeo did. Nadeo's levels mostly seemed to focus on playing into the overall vibe the game was going for, using unusual elements not found in most other racing games and trying to seem like they could be interesting to play. Meanwhile players converged on a few distinct styles of maps that were found to work well to hunt and compete on such as tech and fullspeed. Tech is focused on technical drifts around {adjective} corners, while fullspeed is entirely based on maintaining and snowballing momentum throughout the entire map. Of course not all player made maps fit into defined styles and plenty of mappers have experimented and created incredible levels by going outside of them. Styles have evolved and many more have become popular in the last 15 years, but almost all maps built to be speedran or played in live competitions focus on flow based level design.

This means minimizing downtime and ensuring that the player is always doing something to go faster. A map that flows will have every turn and element connect, or rather flow seamlessly into one other. You can ask 50 trackmania players and you'll get 20 different answers for what flow means, not because anyone agrees but because 30 of them don't actually have an answer even though the word is thrown around constantly when discussing mapping. I'm not trying to say that this is THE meaning of how we use the word, but it is a meaning that I think is important and useful. If you are designing a level for speedrunning in any game flow should be your number one priority. Time spent not executing inputs will be boring and annoying when you're attempting the same level hundreds or thousands of times in order to get the perfect run, and elements not spaced out properly or too close together will feel awkward to play.

I love the trackmania map editor, I've made tons of maps and spent thousands of hours in it. It's so much fun to see what everyone else builds as well, the map editor honestly one of the main reasons I care so much about this game. With an endless supply of new and interesting user made maps, the focus shifts from endlessly optimizing a single run to instead playing and competing on a myriad of player made ones. {this is what I meant when I said you don't have to learn a single game's run and route, and instead become skilled with the game's mechanics in general}. 

Without a single definitive leaderboard, trackmania players needed another way to compete to be the best at the game. Enter: cup mode and other live competitions.

Most trackmania competitions are played in some form of a rounds mode, where in players compete in rounds driving times (without car collisions) on a map or series of maps until someone is the winner. It's essentially a series of many short speedrun races to determine who is the best. Note that most trackmania players just engage with the normal speedrunning gameplay loop as the primary mode, but this fills an important role for players who want to directly compete with others in a match setting.

{Through most of tm history the 'top players' in an esports sense have generally been viewed as the players who preform best in a match setting, and that's where you'll find world championships etc. There are plenty of ways to compete in trackmania, I'm saying that the best player at hunting maps in a certain style isn't good or anything.} 

There are solo competitions, team competitions, trained and untrained competitions, knockout competitions, even just normal time attack gameplay with a limited window to set the best time you can, and more on a variety of map styles, although of course some formats are more popular than others.

Map design for rounds based modes differ a bit from designing for hunting because players must be able to drive the map consistently. The current trackmania game, tm2020, has a daily knockout and hunting cup on featured user made maps, the track of the day. {add some information on screen about the format and clarifying that both are on the same map}. This is one of if not the most popular parts of the game among players who log in regularly, with thousands of players competing every day, and is honestly an amazing mode.

The thing is the track/cup of the day is the only place that really features user maps, at least officially, and if your map isn't in it or a player run tournament it'll be hard to get people to play or even notice it. Trackmania Exchange is the main website for sharing maps, however it is almost entirely used by other mappers, and itself doesn't have that great of discoverability either. The poor discoverability of maps outside of track of the day limits experimentation, reducing the variety of and homogenizing maps. Any track made for track of the day needs to work well in normal time trial gameplay and a knockout competition with 15 minutes to learn that is played by everyone from mapping enthusiasts who happen to be fairly good at the game to the best players in the world to people who are brand new to the game. It's not that it isn't possible to make a great map for this context that will be enjoyed by players of all skill levels, it's that the range of maps that will fit here are far smaller than the range of possible maps that can be built and enjoyed by some amount of the playerbase. If you're extrinsically motivated by beating other people and would like to play maps that don't appeal to the lowest common denominator and work in a cup format, tough luck because since they're not in an official or competitive context the records are probably shit. Unless I hunted the map, then good luck nerd. Oh and also 99.9% of track of the days are forgotten after the day is over. 

Did I mention that the system for selecting maps for track of the day is widely hated and requires you to spend as much time grinding the shitty map review server as you did making your track to have any hope of it getting accepted? Or how the game went two years without a major content update until they released one in November which happened to break tons of maps created before the update due to the update adding a new wood texture and blocks. This was initially assumed by players to be a bug that would be quickly patched, then nadeo doubled down on it citing that having two wood surfaces with different physics would be confusing, never mind the countless other surfaces using the same real world material and different textures & physics. This lead to a days long argument between players and nadeo, ending with nadeo deciding that for some reason having old maps behave differently than new ones with the same blocks and textures would be less confusing than just having two different sets of wood blocks behave differently, which is simply baffling. {on screen mention how it also had unique blocks that will now just be made as items} It's a subscription game, which isn't inherently bad, oh wait {echo 2 years without content update}. There are always bugs being introduced and the game being made deliberately worse in small ways, we haven't been able to open the settings menu from the map editor in almost a year now. Nadeo is constantly making decisions that don't make any logical sense and seem to only further management's strange vision for what they want the game to be, upsetting players. And no it's not just the typical super good players demanding the game be design specifically to benefit them, although that might be reasonable considering nadeo seems to hold every inch of the game sacred for new players leaving no mode with more experienced ones as the higher priority. The competitive ranked mode has never been in the same format as the esports side of things, even when nadeo told us they would fix that they instead didn't do or say anything for the following half a year, at which point they said they were leaving it as is for the benefit of new console players, with no further explanation for what that meant leaving players to speculate what that meant, Nadeo's communication has been notoriously awful for the past 20 years. Ranked matches are played on the seasonal campaign, which itself is seemingly made with the design sensibilities of nadeo's tmnf campaign despite contracting community mappers to make it for them. After a particularly hated campaign was released, the CEO of nadeo made an apology post, however he completely missed the point of players' criticisms. {zoom in on sorry experts} When I gave him some example instances of map design in the campaign that were horrible for both new players and experts, his response wasn't to give counterpoints or admit he was wrong, but rather to tell me that I'm wrong and he knows everything because he made the stadium physics 20 years ago. 

{point out that my reply was the most liked reply & that he contradicts himself by having his entire argument if you can call it that based on him knowing everything due to making the stadium physics 20 years ago but also saying that he has a lot to learn. Maybe mention on screen my theory of nadeo's map design being based around aesthetics} 

And you know what, for all it's faults, trackmania does have some damn fucking good stadium car physics.



Games like neon white exist, with the same speedrun based gameplay loop as trackmania, but neon white doesn't have a level editor. Celeste's modding tools include a map editor, however the lack of in game leaderboard and celeste's general focus on difficulty of completion rather than speed means the focus seems to always be elsewhere.

I've had a lot of fun with the modded celeste map editor recently, and while I enjoy the trialy {need diff word} gameplay in small amounts, I just can't connect to it in the same way I have time trials. I lack the patience to die and reset so many times, even though that's basically the same thing you do in a speedrun. What's the difference? I'm honestly not sure, perhaps it's just nice to feel good at a level as you try it over, and over, and over, and over...

To me, the trackmania car is a wonderful vehicle for the time trial gameplay and level editor. While the stadium car is nothing short of a miracle, there are plenty of other games with great mechanics and physics, but there is *no* other game with the same combination of user made maps and a speedrun focus, and I wish there was.

Thanks for watching.
