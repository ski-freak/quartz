Instructions for rendering replays in high quality


![[Pasted image 20231125181414.png]]

- Use the grass valley codec instead of Lagarith Lossless if you are using davinci resolve.
- If you want 16:9 aspect ratio use 2560x1440 or whatever your preferred resolution is. 1440p or higher is recommended for youtube as you get much better compression.
- DON'T render in 16:9 and add black bars, if you do you are very dumb.
- My [discord server](https://discord.gg/sRB54zg) has a different set of instructions with images if you want to use that instead.
