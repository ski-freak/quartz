Project Gamma is a drafting card game / custom cube I have been working on with a few others. I will make more information available when the game is ready to be played at least in a beta state. If you would like to help with the design of the game mechanics, the cards (we need 360), or visuals (graphic design of the cards, art, both of which being as minimal as possible to be done and printable in mostly black and white), feel free to reach out to me and maybe I'll get you involved.

Also the name won't stay as project gamma forever, unlike project delta, this is just a work in progress project name.
