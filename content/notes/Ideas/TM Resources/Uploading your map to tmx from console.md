If you are a new console player, you may wonder how you can upload your map to trackmania exchange so others find and play it. Once you've finished making your map, follow these steps to upload it to Trackmania Exchange:

1. Upload the map to Nadeo's servers (submit it to Map Review, use the ![☁️](https://discord.com/assets/2dca92362bfc20b452d3.svg) icon in the track browser, or upload it to a club room/campaign if you have Club access).
2. On your PC/phone, visit [https://www.trackmania.com/](https://www.trackmania.com/ "https://www.trackmania.com/") and log in with your Ubisoft account.
3. Navigate to your tracks using the menu at the top, and download the map you just made.
4. Go to [https://trackmania.exchange/](https://trackmania.exchange/ "https://trackmania.exchange/") and log in there.
5. Upload the map.
