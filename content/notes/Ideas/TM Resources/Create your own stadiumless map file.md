**How to create a stadiumless map yourself:**

1. Get the AllDecorationsUnlocker plugin for Openplanet from PluginManager
2. Enable it under Plugins → AllDecorationsUnlocker → use the recommended option
    - you'll need to do this after every game restart, if you're trying to create a stadiumless map
3. Create a map through the regular menus
    - The map will have a stadium; that's intended
    - You can also use the create a map script in the openplanet scripts drop down, this will allow you to make the map any size you like (going past 255 in any direction will cause issues.)
1. Save the map and exit to menu
2. Go to Edit Maps menu picker
3. Hold Ctrl and click on the map you want to remove the Stadium on
4. Pick "Default"
    - or a custom mod
5. Pick "{mood} (no decorations)"
6. Pick "Cars"
    - this last one doesn't have a "Confirm" button for some reason - it'll get immidiately confirmed automatically
7. Voilà! Your map is now stadiumless
