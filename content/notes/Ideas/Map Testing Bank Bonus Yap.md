& like, i honestly dont think im the best critic or anything, I often struggle to remember to apply explanations of basic concepts or take a more holistic view (which the vneck video does well), or go into detail on why things are good unless I really like them. My map feedback is less like an interesting video game review and more focused on the details of route mapping for high level players. When I do make a video or more often a text post going into more detail, I tend to just pick a specific design topic to go into a lot of detail on. Most of the stuff in the vneck video are things I would never even think to say, as they're much broader in focus than what I am used to.

At the same time I'm just so despairge when it comes to this game, I cant bring myself to do more than i already am for giving out information, especially when it comes to scripted videos. I'm just not gonna make a scripted video unless the entire point is to make a neat video about something, im not gonna do it unless I just feel like doing it, its too much work. Currently I'm working on a video about some tmnf tas stuff, which I think is pretty cool. At some point I'd like to make a long video about fs transitional / high difficulty mapping, and talk about the general map design for the style & some specific maps like the clearvision sideways optical illusion map from tm2, but who knows when I will do that, such things take an extreme amount of time and effort. Could be months, years, or never.

I'm also extremely bad at reading out scripts which is fairly painful step in the process, when combined with spending even longer than the initial recording session to cut out the bad takes in resolve
