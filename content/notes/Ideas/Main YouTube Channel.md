My 'main' YouTube channel is currently the project I take the most seriously, or rather care about the most. I'm making videos that I think are interesting, not tied to any format or topic, and trying to get better at it. The videos ideally should all be understandable by a general audience, and not require any previous knowledge on the subjects.

You can find the channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@Ski_Freak)

I made this channel after I decided that primarily making videos on trackmania over on the [[SkiFreakTM Channel]], for a trackmania familiar audience, was too narrow and often relatively uninteresting to create.
