Currently functioning as my second channel. Originally made for scripted trackmania content, since my focus shifted to the new [[Main YouTube Channel]]. Moving forward I am posting basically anything that I want to make that doesn't fit on the main channel here, so probably trackmania commentary and shower thought tier videos, along with anything goofy I come up with. ^81tmn4

You can find the channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@SkiFreakTM)
