Moving forward I will be making some text posts / articles here.

Moving forward I will be making some text posts / articles on this website. Here are some series I am making:
- [#Reflection](./tags/reflection) - Reflections is a series about looking back on videos and other projects of mine that have been completed.
- [#TM Theory](./tags/tmtheory) - TM Theory is a series about my ideas and theories pertaining to Trackmania.
- [#TheLens](./tags/thelens) - The Lens is a series where I look at, and possibly over or under analyze whatever is on my mind. Topics are likely to be related to technology, the social landscape of the internet, and youtube.
- [#Post](./tags/post) - All the posts in one chronological feed.

It's possible I will make some of them into videos at some point, but editing little videos is kind of annoying to me. I like editing videos where I am trying to make the best thing I can, not just trying to get through the tedious process since all of the important decisions have already been made when writing. I guess if I find someone who would want to edit for a percentage of the single digit revenues the videos generate that could work out.
