My 'main' YouTube channel is currently the project I take the most seriously, or rather care about the most. I'm making videos that I think are interesting, not tied to any format or topic, and trying to get better at it. The videos ideally should all be understandable by a general audience, and not require any previous knowledge on the subjects. ^ncko0b

You can find the channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@Ski_Freak)

I made it after I decided that making videos on trackmania was too narrow, and in most cases trackmania topics simply didn't feel worth the effort it took.
