You might say it is a deterministic system, the same initial state will always lead to the same outcome. Unfortunately, in video games this is not always the case.\n\nThis is a simple piston setup in minecraft bedrock edition, and as you can see, it doesn't always work the same way. If we hop back over to java minecraft, it's predictable. Even if we power the pistons at exactly the same time, \nBedrock redstone is non deterministic, it is... random. This is obviously quite horrible for what is essentially a logic simulation, as a wise mustachioed man once said, it's basically like if 2+2 equaled 4, most of the time, but occasionally added up to five. While this doesn't always cause problems, when combined with other differences it has caused the vast majority of the technical minecraft community to exist almost exclusively on the java version of the game, where things are predictable, consistent, and deterministic.\n\nWhen there is 100% order and nothing is left to luck, incredible things are possible.\n\n{autolevel montage, pf, mc circuits, mario maker, geometry dash} some kind of classical music maybe Tchaikovsky or swan lake or smth\n\nIn my last video I mentioned trackmania press forward maps, custom levels designed to finish themselves, all you need to do as the player is hold the forward button. The concept of a level playing itself is pretty old, I was unable to determine the earliest instance of one, but they've been built often by players in level editors for decades now. Geometry dash and the super mario maker games are also good examples.\n\nThere is a real craft to making these maps, and the difference between one made by someone who has made 100 or zero is immediately obvious. While driving the maps doesn't take any skill, the ability to create interesting tricks and smooth landings definitely does. There's all kinds of these automatic levels, ones where you have to press left or right, or even nothing at all. As I mentioned in the other video, player made press forward tracks have gotten an insane number of views on youtube and tiktok over the years, and it's possible that more people have seen them than actually know what trackmania is. No matter the variety, they are only possible because the trackmania physics engine is deterministic.\n\nIf you drive a time in tm, if you do the same inputs again, the exact same thing will happen. This obviously leads to the conclusion that the game has no rng, which in the traditional sense of the word. You will however, find a certain subset of players and viewers saying that because of this, no map is random and calling anything on a track random is wrong, but reality is a bit more complicated than that.\n\nThis is a double pendulum. \nit demonstrates chaos. \ntrackmania is chaotic. \n{I need to expand on the above points, they are just there as placeholders since I wanted to keep writing other stuff}\n\neven if you don't buy into that and still want to get out your nerd emoji and say actually it's technically not random, there are still external factors. Even if you move your thumb the same way on the analog stick of your controller, you'll probably get a slightly different result, because it's not a perfect instrument, and then that uncontrollable variable will have a butterfly effect on the chaotic system and create what is essentially a random outcome. \n{resprit end of video thing}\n\nObviously these are all just technicalities, almost every map in trackmania is relatively consistent, at least in the newer games. The engine being deterministic doesn't really impact normal gameplay very much, even though it can be fun to use technicalities to point out to your favorite streamer that it's all just skill issue and they need to git gud.\n\nThere is another practical use for the game being deterministic, however. Back in tmnf and tm2, before there were official online leaderboards, replay files collected on player made websites and servers were how you kept track of who had the best times. The input data for these replays was unencrypted, and the game actually had a feature to verify the legitimacy of a given replay. This is possible because you can just play back those inputs, and if it matches the time on the replay, then you know the replay wasn't driven using speed hacks for example.\n\n{damn it i forgot to talk about fighting games, I'll put it here later. they are notable for this video because they also control the frame rate in order to make everything visually conistent and have everything that ever happens in the game be communitcated to to the players in the same way each time}\n\nWhile rather cool and interesting, a lot of these benefits of having aspects of a game be deterministic simply don't matter for most games, so it makes sense that many aren't. You may recall hearing another fun fact however, that computers are not truly random. Why then, aren't all games deterministic by default?\n\n----\nEverything in this coming section is a complete mess due to lack of reliable information that I could find. The structure is also a mess because I kept changing it as I was going due to finding different contradictory information.\n\nThat varies depending the game, and it turns out that the old fun fact about computers never being random is only partially true. It is possible to generate random numbers by taking external inputs and using them as a basis for generating your random number. For example, you could take the movements of the user's mouse, and then do some math with that in order to get an actually random number. Many games utilize player actions and inputs to determine the seed for their rng, since it's a relatively easy way to do it. This is why it is possible for players to reverse engineer and manipulate the rng in games like minecraft. Whether this has anything to do with bedrock redstone however, I cannot know. {should I cut this entire part? and just ignore that people who think they are very smart will comment about computers not being random? probably}\n\nThat varies depending the game, and since I'm not a minecraft developer I have no clue why bedrock redstone is broken, it could be due to any number of reasons. Speaking more generally, however, there's a few things that make it rather inconvenient or difficult to ensure determinism.\n\n\nthe answer has to do with math, and why your calculator sometimes lies to you.\nalso it doesn't matter most of the time, for the same reason that the chaos in trackmania usually never matters. {this is nice but only works if you put it in place of the previous block, so instead we move onto below I guess?}\n\nSometimes, your calculator lies to you.\nThese floating point numbers will always be consistent with themselves, if you do the same floating point calculation on the same system you will get the same result. However, on different hardware the result won't always be the same. This is due to blah blah blah cpu architecture etc.\n\nphysx, the physics engine that both unity and unreal engine use, will only be deterministic if you use the enhanced determinism mode, which forces all calculations to happen in a fixed order, basically. \n\nIn order for a physics engine to be deterministic, it needs to not use floating point numbers, only ever advance the simulation by fixed time steps, and all interactions must be resolved in a set order. If any of these aren't the case, or perhaps other factors I am not aware of as well, then it won't always be deterministic. It's understandable then\n\n\nThis information is impossible to turn into any statement that I can be sure is correct, I don't know what to do. Here are some links that seemed relatively useful.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7h0b4f/why_isnt_the_unity_physics_engine_deterministic/\nhttps://www.stevestreeting.com/2020/07/26/using-bullet-for-physics-in-ue4/#:~:text=UE%20uses%20PhysX%20(like%20Unity,in%20a%20fixed%2C%20repeatable%20order\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7365790/how-can-floating-point-calculations-be-made-deterministic\nhttps://forum.unity.com/threads/physx-determinism.127300/\n\n--end impossibly annoying to research and verify section--\n\n----\n\nAllow me to ask you a question, why, in tabletop card games like magic the gathering and pokemon, as well as similar online games, do we shuffle the decks before we start playing? The obvious answer is that it makes each game more unique, like a minecraft seed. But if you think a bit more about what the game would look like if players could order their cards, it becomes a bit more clear. When you know ahead of time what cards you will have, and there is no variance in execution as it is just a card game, there is essentially no game to play anymore. You have already determined all of your moves, and unless your opponent has a surprise for you, which basically never happens within such environments, then the game once again plays itself, just like the trackmania press forward maps. Players of these games have experimented with using unlimited numbers of a single card in their deck, or ordering cards, and each time it ceases to be a game and becomes a puzzle to find the most unbeatable pile of cards. In a way the entire point of shuffling your cards and not knowing your opponent's in pokemon, magic, or hearthstone, is to prevent the game from becoming deterministic.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n\n\nA while back a friend on discord shared with me a concept for a card game in which it is the hidden information that prevents the game from being deterministic, rather than random cards. These long running card games really weren't designed to be played in a way where you have access to all your cards, and are completely broken when you do. Perhaps, if you designed a game explicitly around the choices and interactions between hidden but always available cards, you could make it work\n{I should just cut this part as well, its kind of interesting but really doesn't fit, better to end at the end of the last block}","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":["wipvideo"]},"/notes/WipVideo/Script-Why-Nobody-Speedruns":{"title":"Script - Why Nobody Speedruns","content":"This is the history of the ultra shortcut, by summoning salt, one of the most famous and recognizable speedrunning youtubers. It's a fascinating documentary about how Mario Kart Wii players were able to completely break certain tracks, creating some incredible shortcuts. This video alone has over 12 million views. Mario kart Wii sold 37 million copies. About a thousand people have speedran mario kart wii.\n\n{nobody cares about speedrunning title}\n\nSpeedrunning is a relatively simple concept, finish a game or complete a goal as fast as possible. Players have been competing to be the fastest to beat various games for decades, even before the internet, but it really took off in the 2010s* when speedruns and related videos gained immense popularity on youtube. Despite this, the player base for actually speedrunning remains microscopic to this day compared to the tens of millions of people worldwide who enjoy watching speedrun videos and livestreams.\n\nIt is undeniable that there is at least a perceived barrier to entry to speedrun most games. Being expected to read community made rules, record yourself, and submit your attempt to a 3rd party website is a bit more involved than downloading a new game and playing it. Many may also get the impression that they need a fancy timer or certain mods or to learn a complex route simply to get started. Some games are only available on console or emulator, the former of which may be harder to record from and the latter can be a bit of a process to set up, but even pc games never seem to have a big speedrunning scene either.\n\nMost games would kill to have the amount of attention that has been directed at even relatively unpopular speedruns, and yet speedrunning largely remains contained to youtube and twitch streams. \nStill, to me this doesn't fully explain the absurdly small amount of players relative to viewers, surely 20 million people aren't so lazy that only a few hundredths of a percent of them have actually given it a try? Perhaps it is worth examining whether the very videos that have made speedrunning a global phenomenon are the reason it remains such a niche community.\n\n{summoning salt clips from ultra shortcut vid}\n\nWhen you see how mario kart players do near perfect inputs and grab invisible checkpoints to achieve ultra shortcuts, does that make you want to pick up mario kart wii and speedrun it? Probably not, slamming yourself into a wall over and over until you get a trick isn't a very appealing prospect, but does make for a really interesting video. \n\nBeyond general documentaries about interesting events and people, speedrunning videos have found a number popular formats. There's the world record uploads, tool assisted speedruns, videos explaining runs, world record progression videos, videos about cheaters, as well as challenge runs \u0026 other videos that revolve around a creator doing some kind of run for content.\n\nThe thing about most of these video genres is that they directly benefit from sensationalizing or otherwise focusing on the extremes of speedrunning to create an entertaining video. Accomplishments and skilled runners are hyped into the stratosphere, and difficult parts of runs such as skips are focused on. This all makes sense, and there isn't really anything inherently wrong with it. If you're going to make a video, you're probably going to gravitate to the coolest and most interesting events. You're probably going to focus on the most difficult challenges faced, it's how narratives tend to work. However, what creates a good video and engaging narrative often doesn't align with what most people would be interested in playing themselves. \n\n{wr progression edit}\nThe world record progression format practically necessitates consistently increasing the stakes and gravity of accomplishments as the video goes on, or at least keeping it at a constant. It of course also tends to focus on the strangest stories and most difficult achievements and obstacles players faced. Each new discovery, new route, new skip must be presented in an exciting or entertaining way, each new record better than the last. World record progressions aren't bad, they're essentially a vehicle to explore how a speedrun evolved over time, but they often don't present something that would be fun for the average person. \n\nChallenge runs and other weird speedruns are interesting, and in some ways they can be more accessible than an actual speedrun, seeing as you may be willing to participate without submitting to a leaderboard. Players have been putting restrictions on their playthroughs and going for weird goals for as long as games have been around. The thing is, as time goes on it seems like more and more often these challenges and alternate speedruns that creators do are focused on being novel and clickable, as more concepts become old and stale. There's tons of videos on youtube of people \"speedrunning\" random objectives as a spectacle. {insert clickable challenge that is barely even a speedrun and is basically just a random thing for views}.\n\nPeople are fascinated with cheaters. Speedrun cheating videos have long been extremely popular, and for a long time a majority of the most viewed speedrun related videos on youtube were about cheaters and cheated runs. {possibly cut this {It goes without saying that while they make for interesting stories, cheaters aren't exactly appealing.}} While I doubt that they scare many away, I'm sure they're not convincing anyone to speedrun, at least anyone legitimate.\n{that's right, we're gonna cheat clip}\n\nNow what if an entire game fell into this same problem, a game with near zero advertisement and popular content that doesn't reflect what a normal player would do.\n\n---\nTrackmania is a racing game that, in essence, condenses the gameplay loop of speedrunning down to individual short, fast paced tracks. There's a lot more to the game, for example live races against other players such as the cup of the day, and powerful editor tools that allow for the creation of some truly insane race tracks, but the main way most people interact with the game is trying to set fast times on individual levels.\n\n---\n\nIf you've heard of trackmania, it was probably in one of a few ways. You may have seen press forward maps, auto levels with crazy flips where you simply hold a single input and the map drives itself. These have always been popular on youtube and have in recent years gained a new {following} as common background visual stimulation footage for tiktoks. These are visually cool, and there is a certain craft to building this kind of track, but they obviously don't reflect actual gameplay at all and most viewers will never think twice about the game that made them possible.\n\nThe most popular content creator for trackmania by far is wirtual, who makes videos similar to that of some speedrunning channels. Many of these videos feature records, tricks, and shortcuts, unique challenges, and more, often in an older entry in the series, trackmania nations forever. Just like speedrunning videos, you don't have to look far into the comments to see people talking about how they've never played the game and love the video.\n\nYou wouldn't think it's weird if I said that 15 million view Press Forward map videos \u0026 tiktok backgrounds don't attract many people to the game, and really press forward maps are about as different as uberbug world record grinders are to the gameplay loop of typical players. Most trackmania players are not grinding incredibly inconsistent shortcuts and trying to get perfect runs, \n\n---\nthe appeal to trackmania is in a way the same as speedrunning: it's fun to try to improve your personal best, reaching for your own goal.\n\n---\nTrackmania isn't a big game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not dead either. The barrier to entry to trackmania is much lower than speedrunning a game, even though the gameplay loop has an obvious resemblance.\n\nThe technical factors and accessibility are just as important as the content in my opinion for attracting players to any game or sub game, but it seems easy to overlook how the presentation of speedruns to the wider internet may be a major factor in why nobody speedruns.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, being expected to read community made rules, record yourself, and submit your attempt to a 3rd party website is a bit more involved than downloading a new game and playing it. Unless the process of onboarding players is streamlined significantly, it seems likely that speedrunning will continue to be a niche activity for the foreseeable future. For console exclusive games this is effectively impossible, as it will always require extra effort to record, or emulate a console game. PC games possibly have a bit more hope though. Perhaps some games could have mods that create a sort of speedrun mode that records a replay of the gameplay and serves as an automatic submission to a leaderboard. How much effort it takes as a player to mod a game varies depending on the title, what would be ideal is developer support.\n\nCeleste includes a speedrun mode with a timer, and this is great, it removes a step that you would normally have to set up to run the game, but I think the concept could be taken further. With a replay system built into a game, it would be a lot easier and more convenient for new players to get video proof of their runs. Maybe within the speedrun mode menu you could have an easy way to submit your best replay to the speedrun.com page and it's community moderators. Having an in game leaderboard would be sick, and some games actually do this when it's part of the core gameplay, such as Neon White, but the sad reality of these is that they often get filled with cheaters, and it's not very realistic to ask developers to implement anti cheat in their mostly single player games or verify the runs themselves.\n\nIt seems unlikely that any triple a game would bother with this, but seeing as we've seen indy games take small steps already like the celeste speedrun mode, maybe other indy games will push the concept further in the future. There's a huge amount of viewership for speedrun content, and if you could attract more players from it by making it easy to participate that would theoretically make more money.\n\nIn fact, recently we saw the perfect example of a game that could have benefited from a speedrun replay mode or leaderboard: Only Up. If you somehow managed to miss it, Only Up is a Platformer slash rage game that took the streaming and speedrun space by storm this May. There's one level filled with a bunch of random 3d assets, and you need to jump all the way up to the top, and if you fall, it's a long way down with no checkpoints. On release Only Up quickly rose to be the most popular speedgame, if any game could have benefited from attracting more players from speedrun content it would have been this one.\n\nAnother thing I saw recently is the developer of an indie automation game\n\nThis video isn't meant to say that any of the content I mentioned is bad, I quite like a lot of it. In the end all publicity may be good publicity, but in the absence of developer support you'll need a lot more than good to convince people to speedrun.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n\nNote: make and record both trackmania explaining bits\n\nNote: add these\n- But what you need to understand is that a perceived barrier to entry is essentially the same as an actual one when it comes to attracting participants to something. They will not know that it is not actually that bad until after they have surpassed the barrier or lack of it.\n- im sure anyone making a video on a game with such a feature it would mention how easy it is to go speedrun for yourself\n- even if a replay system is not as fool proof as video recording, the leaderboard could simply require video verification for top runs.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":["wipvideo"]},"/tags/evergreen/":{"title":"Evergreen","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]},"/tags/idea/":{"title":"Idea","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]},"/tags/navigation/":{"title":"Navigation","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]},"/tags/post/":{"title":"Post","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]},"/tags/video/":{"title":"Video","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]},"/tags/wipvideo/":{"title":"WipVideo","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T04:19:47.234091254Z","tags":[]}}
